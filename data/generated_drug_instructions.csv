Phenylephrine,"Why is this medication prescribed? Phenylephrine is used to relieve nasal discomfort caused by colds, allergies, and hay fever, and to ease sinus congestion and pressure. It reduces symptoms but does not treat the underlying cause or speed recovery. Phenylephrine is a nasal decongestant that works by shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages. How should this medicine be used? Phenylephrine is taken by mouth as a tablet, liquid, or orally dissolving strip. It is usually taken every 4 hours as needed. Follow the directions on your prescription or package label exactly, and ask your doctor or pharmacist if anything is unclear. Do not take more or less than directed or use it more often than recommended. Phenylephrine is available alone or in combination with other ingredients; ask your doctor or pharmacist which product is best for your symptoms. Carefully check labels before using two or more cough and cold products together; many contain the same active ingredients, and taking them together could cause an overdose. This is especially important for children. Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including those with phenylephrine, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 4 years old. If you give them to children 4 to 11 years old, use caution and follow package directions exactly. If you are giving phenylephrine or a combination product with phenylephrine to a child, read the label to be sure it is appropriate for the child’s age. Do not give adult formulations to children. Before dosing a child, check the label’s age-based dosing chart and give the recommended dose; ask the child’s doctor if you are unsure. If using the liquid, measure doses with the provided device or a medication-measuring spoon or cup, not a household spoon. Stop phenylephrine and call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve within 7 days or if you develop a fever. For dissolving strips, place one strip on your tongue and allow it to dissolve. Other uses for this medicine This medication may also be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. What special precautions should I follow? Before taking phenylephrine, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to phenylephrine, any other medications, or any ingredients in phenylephrine products. Do not take phenylephrine if you are taking, or have taken within the past 2 weeks, a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar), or tranylcypromine (Parnate). Tell your doctor and pharmacist about all prescription and nonprescription drugs, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you take or plan to take. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had high blood pressure, diabetes, difficulty urinating due to an enlarged prostate, thyroid disease, or heart disease. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding; if you become pregnant while taking phenylephrine, call your doctor. If you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking phenylephrine. If you have phenylketonuria (PKU), be aware that some phenylephrine products may be sweetened with aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. What special dietary instructions should I follow? Unless your doctor advises otherwise, continue your normal diet. What should I do if I forget a dose? This medication is usually taken as needed. If your doctor has told you to take phenylephrine on a regular schedule and you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. What side effects can this medication cause? Phenylephrine may cause side effects. Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following, stop using phenylephrine and call your doctor: nervousness, dizziness, or trouble sleeping. Phenylephrine may cause other side effects."
Pyrethrin and Piperonyl Butoxide Topical,"Why is this medication prescribed? Pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide shampoo is used to treat lice—small insects that attach to the skin on the head, body, or pubic area ('crabs')—in adults and in children 2 years of age and older. Pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide is in a class of medications called pediculicides and works by killing lice. How should this medicine be used? Pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide comes as a shampoo to apply to the skin and hair. It is usually used in two or three treatments; the second treatment must be applied 7 to 10 days after the first, and a third treatment may be recommended by your doctor if needed. Follow the directions on your prescription or package label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain anything you do not understand. Use pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide shampoo exactly as directed; do not use more or less or use it more often than instructed. The package label estimates how much shampoo you need based on hair length; be sure to use enough to cover all of your scalp and hair. Use only on the skin or on the hair and scalp. Avoid the eyes, nose, mouth, and vagina. Do not use on eyebrows or eyelashes. If the shampoo gets in your eyes, flush with water right away; if irritation persists after rinsing, call your doctor or seek medical help immediately. To use: Shake the bottle well right before use. Cover your face and eyes with a towel and keep your eyes closed during treatment; an adult may need to help with application. Apply the shampoo to dry hair and scalp or to affected skin. For head lice, start behind the ears and at the back of the neck, then cover all hair and scalp. Leave on for 10 minutes—no longer—and use a timer or clock to track the time. After 10 minutes, add a small amount of warm water to form a lather and shampoo as usual, then rinse hair, scalp, or skin thoroughly with warm water. For head lice, towel-dry the hair, comb out tangles, and consider using a lice comb to remove dead lice and nits (empty egg shells); an adult may need to help. Repeat the entire process in 7 to 10 days to kill lice that hatch from eggs. After treatment, sanitize recently used clothing, underwear, pajamas, hats, sheets, pillowcases, and towels by washing in very hot water or dry-cleaning. Wash combs, brushes, hair clips, and other personal care items in hot water. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer’s patient information.

Hydrocortisone Injection,"Why is this medication prescribed? Hydrocortisone injection is used to treat symptoms of low corticosteroid levels (lack of certain substances normally produced by the body and needed for normal function) and to treat severe allergic reactions. It is also used in the management of multiple sclerosis, lupus, gastrointestinal diseases, and certain types of arthritis, as well as conditions affecting the blood, skin, eyes, nervous system, thyroid, kidneys, and lungs. Hydrocortisone injection is a corticosteroid. It works by replacing steroids that the body typically makes on its own when levels are low and, for other conditions, by reducing swelling and redness and by modifying immune system activity. How should this medicine be used? Hydrocortisone injection comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid and is given intramuscularly (into a muscle) or intravenously (into a vein). The dosing schedule depends on your condition and response to treatment. It may be administered in a hospital or clinic, or you may be instructed to use it at home. If using it at home, your healthcare provider will teach you how to prepare and inject the medication; be sure you understand the directions and ask questions if anything is unclear. Ask your provider what to do if you have problems using the injection. Your doctor may change your dose during treatment to ensure you are using the lowest effective dose and may adjust it if you experience physical stress (such as surgery, illness, or infection) or if your symptoms change. This medication may also be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. What special precautions should I follow? Before receiving hydrocortisone injection, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to hydrocortisone, other medications, benzyl alcohol, or any ingredients in the product; ask your pharmacist for a list of ingredients. Tell them about all prescription and nonprescription drugs, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you take or plan to take. Nonprescription products that may interact include aspirin and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve). Do not start these while receiving hydrocortisone without discussing with your healthcare provider. Do not use hydrocortisone injection if you have a systemic fungal infection (other than on the skin or nails). If you have idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), your doctor will probably avoid intramuscular injections. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had tuberculosis; cataracts; glaucoma; Cushing’s syndrome; diabetes; high blood pressure; heart failure; a recent heart attack; emotional problems, depression, or other mental illness; myasthenia gravis; osteoporosis; seizures; ulcers; or liver, kidney, heart, intestinal, or thyroid disease; and if you have any untreated bacterial, parasitic, or viral infection or a herpes eye infection. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding; call your doctor if you become pregnant while receiving hydrocortisone. If you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the surgeon or dentist that you are receiving hydrocortisone. Do not receive vaccinations without talking to your doctor. Hydrocortisone may decrease your ability to fight infection and can mask infection symptoms; avoid people who are sick, wash your hands often, and stay away from anyone with chickenpox or measles. Call your doctor right away if you think you were exposed to chickenpox or measles. What special dietary instructions should I follow? Your doctor may recommend a low-salt diet or a diet higher in potassium or calcium and may prescribe calcium or potassium supplements. Follow these instructions carefully. What should I do if I forget a dose? If you self-inject and miss a dose, use it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for your next dose; if so, skip the missed dose and resume your regular schedule. Do not use two doses at once. If you miss an appointment for an injection, call your doctor or clinic to reschedule and to receive dosing guidance. What side effects can this medication cause? Hydrocortisone injection may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these are severe or do not go away: headache; dizziness; slowed healing of cuts and bruises; acne; thin, fragile, or dry skin; red or purple blotches or lines under the skin; skin depressions at the injection site; increased body fat or fat redistribution; difficulty falling or staying asleep; inappropriate happiness (euphoria); extreme mood or personality changes; extreme tiredness; depression; increased sweating; muscle weakness; joint pain; irregular or absent menstrual periods; increased appetite; hiccups. Some side effects can be serious. Call your doctor immediately if you have: sore throat, fever, chills, cough, or other signs of infection; seizures; vision problems; swelling of the eyes, face, lips, tongue, throat, arms, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs; stomach swelling or pain; difficulty breathing or swallowing; shortness of breath; sudden weight gain; rash; hives; itching; or abnormal patches in the mouth, nose, or throat. Hydrocortisone injection may slow growth in children; your child’s doctor will monitor growth. Long-term use may increase the risk of glaucoma or cataracts; ask your doctor how often to have eye exams. Hydrocortisone injection may increase the risk of osteoporosis. This medication may cause other side effects; call your doctor if you experience any unusual problems while using it."

It may be combined with other medicines to treat symptoms caused by low corticosteroid levels. It replaces natural steroids when your body does not make enough and also reduces swelling and redness by altering immune activity. It is also sometimes used to control nausea and vomiting from certain cancer chemotherapies and to help prevent organ transplant rejection. Talk with your doctor about the risks of using it for these or any other uses. How should this medicine be used? Methylprednisolone injection comes as a powder that is mixed with liquid and given into a muscle (intramuscularly) or into a vein (intravenously). It also comes as a suspension for injection that can be given into a muscle, a joint (intra‑articularly), or directly into a lesion (intralesionally). Your dose and schedule depend on your condition and response. You may receive doses in a clinic or hospital, or you may be taught to give it at home. If using it at home, have your healthcare provider show you exactly how to prepare and inject it, and ask questions until you are confident. Ask what to do if you have any problems using it. Your doctor may adjust your dose over time to the lowest amount that controls your symptoms, and may change your dose during times of physical stress (such as surgery, illness, or infection). Tell your doctor if your symptoms improve, worsen, or if your health changes during treatment. What special precautions should I follow? Before receiving methylprednisolone injection, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to methylprednisolone, any other medicines, benzyl alcohol, or any ingredients in the product; ask your pharmacist for an ingredient list. Tell them about all prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you take or plan to take. Doses may need adjustment and you may need monitoring for side effects. Over‑the‑counter aspirin and other NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) can interact with methylprednisolone; tell your doctor if you use them, and do not start them while on methylprednisolone without medical advice. Do not use methylprednisolone if you have a fungal infection that is not limited to the skin or nails.
