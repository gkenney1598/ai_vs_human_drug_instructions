insulin lispro injection products are used to treat type 1 diabetes, a condition in which the body does not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, a condition in which the body does not use insulin normally, in patients who need insulin to control their blood sugar. in type 1 diabetes, insulin lispro injection products are always used with another insulin unless delivered by an external insulin pump. in type 2 diabetes, insulin lispro injection products may be used with another insulin or with oral diabetes medicines. these products are short-acting, manmade versions of human insulin. they replace the insulin your body normally makes, help move sugar from the blood into body tissues for energy, and reduce the liver’s production of sugar. managing high blood sugar over time helps lower the risk of serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye disease. using medications as prescribed, making lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and checking your blood sugar regularly can improve your health and lower your chances of heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability), eye problems (including vision changes or loss), and gum disease. your healthcare team will advise you on the best plan to manage your diabetes. how should this medicine be used? insulin lispro injection products come as a solution (liquid) and as a suspension (liquid with particles that settle) for subcutaneous injection under the skin. insulin lispro solution (admelog, humalog) is usually injected within 15 minutes before a meal or immediately after a meal. insulin lispro suspension (humalog mix 75/25 or humalog mix 50/50) should be injected 15 minutes before a meal. insulin lispro-aabc solution (lyumjev) should be injected at the beginning of a meal or within 20 minutes after you start eating. your doctor will tell you how many times per day to inject insulin lispro products. follow your prescription label exactly and ask your doctor or pharmacist if anything is unclear. do not use more or less, or more often, than prescribed. insulin lispro injection products may also be given intravenously by a doctor or nurse in a healthcare setting with careful monitoring. never use insulin lispro injection products if you have symptoms of low blood sugar or your blood sugar reading is low. insulin lispro controls diabetes but does not cure it. continue using it even if you feel well. do not stop, switch brands or types, or change any insulin dose without talking to your doctor. always check the insulin label to be sure you received the correct product. insulin lispro injection products are supplied in vials, cartridges (for use in dosing pens), and prefilled dosing pens. know which container you have and what supplies (needles, syringes, pens) you need. if using vials, inject with the appropriate syringes; ask your healthcare provider to show you how. if using cartridges, purchase a compatible insulin pen; read the pen’s instructions and have your provider teach you how to use it. if using prefilled pens, read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully and always prime the pen before use. never reuse needles or syringes, and never share needles, syringes, cartridges, or pens. if using a pen, remove the needle immediately after injecting. dispose of sharps in a puncture-resistant container and ask your provider how to dispose of the container. your doctor may tell you to mix insulin lispro solution with nph insulin in the same syringe. if so, always draw insulin lispro into the syringe first, use the same brand of syringe each time, and inject immediately after mixing. do not mix insulin lispro injection products with any insulin other than nph. do not mix insulin lispro suspension with any other insulin. your doctor may tell you to dilute insulin lispro to make dosing easier; follow their instructions exactly. inject into the thighs, stomach (abdomen), upper arms, or buttocks. rotate injection sites within the chosen area with each dose. do not inject into skin that is thick, lumpy, tender, bruised, scaly, hard, scarred, or damaged. always check your insulin before use. insulin lispro solution should be clear and colorless; do not use if colored, cloudy, or if it contains particles. insulin lispro suspension should look cloudy or milky after mixing; do not use if there are clumps or solid white particles sticking to the bottom or walls of the container. do not use any insulin past its expiration date. gently roll or shake insulin lispro suspension to mix before use; ask your provider if and how your insulin should be mixed. insulin lispro solution (admelog, humalog u-100, lyumjev u-100) can be used in an external insulin pump. before pump use, confirm the pump is compatible with continuous delivery of rapid-acting insulin, read the pump manual for recommended reservoir and tubing sets, and have your provider show you how to use the pump. do not dilute insulin lispro or mix it with other insulins in the pump. when using an external pump, replace the insulin in the reservoir at least every 7 days (admelog, humalog u-100) or at least every 9 days (lyumjev u-100), and change the infusion set and insertion site at least every 3 days. if the infusion site becomes red, itchy, lumpy, or thickened, move to a different site. high blood sugar can occur quickly if the pump malfunctions, the reservoir is exposed to direct sunlight or temperatures above 98.6°f (37°c), or if tubing leaks, kinks, disconnects, or becomes blocked. if you cannot promptly find and fix the problem, call your doctor right away. you may need to temporarily inject insulin subcutaneously with a syringe or pen. keep back-up insulin and supplies available and know how to use them. this medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. what special precautions should i follow?

ciclesonide is an aerosol inhaled by mouth using its specific inhaler, typically twice daily at about the same times each day. follow your prescription label exactly; do not use more, use less, or use it more often than prescribed. ask your doctor how to use your other asthma medicines (both oral and inhaled) while you are using ciclesonide, including whether to separate them by a certain amount of time. if you are on an oral steroid (such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone [medrol], or prednisone [rayos]), your doctor may begin slowly reducing that dose starting at least 1 week after you begin ciclesonide. ciclesonide helps prevent asthma attacks but will not treat an attack that has already started; do not use it for sudden symptoms. your doctor will give you a quick-relief (short-acting) inhaler for asthma attacks. your doctor will usually start with a standard dose, may increase it if your symptoms are not better after at least 4 weeks, and may lower it once your asthma is controlled. it can take 4 weeks or longer to feel the full benefit. keep using it even if you feel well; do not stop without talking to your doctor. call your doctor if your asthma gets worse, if an attack does not improve with your rescue inhaler, or if you need your rescue medicine more often than usual. use only the inhaler that comes with the ciclesonide canister, and do not use that inhaler with any other medicine. each canister provides 60 inhalations. after the labeled number of doses, sprays may not deliver the correct amount. the attached counter changes every 10 sprays; when it shows 20, contact your doctor or pharmacist for a refill; when it shows 0, stop using that canister. track your daily inhalations to know how many sprays remain. discard the canister once you have used the labeled number of inhalations, even if liquid remains and it still sprays. if the inhaler is dropped, do not rely on the counter to estimate remaining doses. before first use, read the written instructions and review the diagrams; ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to demonstrate proper technique. do not use the inhaler near open flames or heat sources; exposure to very high temperatures can cause it to explode. to use: make sure the inhaler is at room temperature. remove the mouthpiece cap and confirm the canister is fully seated in the actuator. you do not need to shake the inhaler. if this is the first use or if it has not been used for more than 10 days, prime it by releasing 3 sprays into the air away from your face and eyes. breathe out through your mouth. hold the inhaler upright with the mouthpiece at the bottom, place your thumb beneath the mouthpiece and your index finger on the center of the dose indicator at the top of the canister. place the mouthpiece in your mouth, close your lips around it with your tongue below it. breathe in slowly and deeply through your mouth while pressing down firmly on the top of the canister to release the dose. when your lungs are full, hold your breath for about 10 seconds, remove the inhaler, then exhale gently. replace the cap. rinse your mouth with water and spit it out; do not swallow. clean the inhaler weekly with a clean, dry tissue or cloth; do not wash any part of the inhaler in water. what special precautions should i follow?

human insulin injection,"why is this medication prescribed? human insulin is prescribed to control blood sugar in people with type 1 diabetes (when the body makes no insulin) and in people with type 2 diabetes (when the body does not make or use insulin normally) whose blood sugar cannot be controlled with oral medicines alone. it belongs to the hormone class and replaces the insulin your body should produce. it lowers blood sugar by moving glucose from the bloodstream into body tissues for energy and by reducing the liver’s glucose production. all insulins work this way but differ in how quickly they start to act and how long they work. good blood sugar control with medicines, lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regular monitoring can reduce the risk of serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, nerve damage (including numb, cold feet or legs), decreased sexual function in men and women, eye disease and vision loss, and gum disease. your healthcare team will help you plan the best management for your diabetes. how should this medicine be used? human insulin is available as a solution and as a suspension for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. it is usually injected several times daily, and you may need more than one type of insulin. use exactly the types, doses, and schedule your doctor prescribes; do not use more or less or more often than directed. certain solutions (myxredlin, humulin r u-100, novolin r) may be given intravenously by a healthcare professional with close monitoring. insulin controls high blood sugar but does not cure diabetes; continue using it even if you feel well. do not change brands, types, or doses without talking to your doctor. insulin is supplied in vials, prefilled disposable pens, and cartridges for insulin pens. know which container you have and what supplies (needles, syringes, or pens) you need. confirm that the name and letter on your insulin match your prescription. if you use vials, inject with syringes; be sure you know if your insulin is u-100 or u-500 and always use a syringe marked for that strength. use the same brand and model of needle and syringe each time. read the manufacturer’s directions for drawing up and injecting insulin and ask your healthcare provider if you have questions. if using cartridges, you may need to purchase a compatible pen—review the pen’s instructions and have your healthcare provider show you how to use it. if using a disposable pen, read and follow its instructions and get a demonstration from your provider. never reuse needles or syringes, and never share needles, syringes, cartridges, or pens. if using a pen, remove the needle right after the injection. dispose of sharps in a puncture-resistant container and ask your provider how to discard it safely. your doctor may instruct you to mix two insulins in the same syringe; follow the steps exactly and always draw the same type first. do not mix insulins unless told to do so. inspect your insulin before use: regular human insulin (humulin r, novolin r) must be clear, colorless, and as fluid as water—do not use if cloudy, thick, colored, or if particles are present. nph (humulin n, novolin n) and premixed insulins (humulin 70/30, novolin 70/30) should look cloudy or milky after mixing—do not use if clumps or white particles stick to the vial walls or bottom. do not use any insulin past its expiration date. some insulins must be gently mixed (by rolling or inverting); ask your pharmacist how to mix your product if needed. inject into the abdomen, upper arm, thigh, or buttocks; do not inject into muscles, scars, or moles. rotate sites within the same body area, spacing injections at least 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) apart; use all sites in one area before moving to another area. what special precautions should i follow? before using insulin, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to any insulin or any medicines. provide a complete list of all prescription and nonprescription drugs, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you take or plan to take; your doctor may adjust doses or monitor for interactions. nonprescription products such as niacin and salicylates can interact with insulin—do not start them without discussing with your healthcare provider. tell your doctor if you have or have had diabetic nerve damage; heart failure; or heart, adrenal, pituitary, thyroid, liver, or kidney disease. tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding; call your doctor if you become pregnant while using insulin. if you are having any surgery, including dental procedures, inform the provider that you use insulin. alcohol can lower blood sugar; ask your doctor about safe alcohol use. ask your doctor what to do if you are ill, under unusual stress, traveling across time zones, or changing your exercise/activity level, as these can alter your insulin needs. ask how often to check your blood sugar. low blood sugar can impair your ability to drive or operate machinery; ask whether you should test before these activities. what special dietary instructions should i follow? follow the meal and exercise plan from your doctor or dietitian. eat a healthy diet and try to consume similar amounts and types of foods at consistent times each day. skipping or delaying meals or changing the amount or type of food can disrupt blood sugar control. what should i do if i forget a dose?
